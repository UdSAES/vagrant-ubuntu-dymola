Vagrantfile and playbook for installation of Dymola on Ubuntu from scratch using Vagrant

https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/[Dymola] is a state-of-the-art commercial simulation environment for the modelling language https://modelica.org/modelicalanguage[Modelica]. It is available for Windows and Linux operating systems from Dassault Syst√®mes.

Unfortunately, only a few Linux distributions are supported and installation on Linux rarely works out of the box.footnote:[This is just my personal observation. The sample size is insufficient for drawing reliable conclusions.]

This repository provides a machine-readable documentation of all steps necessary to create a virtual machine running Dymola for Linux using https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] and https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox].

== Installation
Vagrant reads the desired configuration of a VM including all software packages to be installed from the files in this repository and ensures that the configuration is realized. In order for this to work, you need to...

* Clone this repository
* Install https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] (version 6.1.18 works for me)
* https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation[Install Vagrant] (version 2.2.15 works for me)
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Install Ansible] (version 2.9.14 works for me)
* Install the https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest[`vagrant-vbguest`-plugin] (version 0.29.0 works for me)
* Copy the directory `linux_x86_64/` from the Dymola installation files into the folder in which you cloned the repository

== Usage
*`TL;DR:` just execute `./install.sh` and wait for completion*. Note that you will have to log into the VM once during installation when prompted.

=== Installation Script
[source,sh]
----
./install.sh # read the script for details
----

The script assumes that the host OS is a Linux-variant. Running on Windows is not supported, but in this case you can just install Dymola natively anyway.

=== Configuration
Configuration is not required, but possible. By default, a VM with 2 CPUs and 2048 MiB RAM is created. The default directories created by GNOME in `/home/vagrant/` are removed and Dymola and the `dassaultsystemes`-library are installed.

* For configuring the VM (RAM, CPUs, ...) edit the `Vagrantfile`.
* For all other settings, edit the `vars`-section at the top of `playbook.yaml`.
